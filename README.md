# FusionCore
FusionCore is a DIY CoreXY configuration 3D printer with 3 seperate compartments each suited for the components inside it. <br/>
The printer is intended for enthusiests are want to build their own printer while also allowing easy customization in an all in one package. <br/>
Currently, only the CAD model of the printer is implemented. The printer has **NOT** been built yet.
